My name is Anthony Wilcox
I am originally from San Diego, CA
I currently live in Northern CA in Rocklin
I like to wakeboard, ski, and spend time at home
with my family when we aren't a youth sporting 
events.  
My wife and I run a small freight business from
our home.  We both have considered going into
teaching or some other kind of work with kids and
hiring other people to run our business.

#Programming Background
I had no experience in programming prior to this program
I had made a word press website and done some very basic
HTML editing but that was without any form of understanding
I was just doing what a video told me to.  
I originally enrolled in CS165, but I felt that I was 
cramming and was going to lose information rather than
understand what I was doing.  I went to CS161 and 162.  I am
really happy I made that decision.  My favorite project was the
final project of CS162.  It tied together pointers, polymorphism, 
inheritance, and ownership of class attributes.  I felt that
there was no real way to properly complete that project without
actually understanding what you are doing.
